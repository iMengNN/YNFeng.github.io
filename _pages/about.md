I am Yuannuo Feng (冯源诺), a PhD student from Beihang University, where I am having the privilege of being guided by [Prof. Wang Kang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wang-Kang-3?ev=prf_highl) and pursuing my doctoral studies in Integrated Circuit Engineering since 2024, with an expected graduation in 2029. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Integrated Circuit Design from Xidian University in 2024, where I graduated and proceeded directly to pursue my PhD at Beihang University. My research focuses on the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Multimodal Models**, and emerging **Compute-in-Memory (CIM)** architectures, with a passion for exploring deployment optimization and hardware-software co-design. I am currently working as an intern at [Zhicun (Witmem) Technology](http://www.witintech.com/), focusing on the intersection of advanced AI models and novel computing architectures.


Research Interests
======
- Computing power drives modern AI, but classical digital computers face challenges due to the separation of compute and storage units. **CIM** integrates memory and computation into a single unit, significantly reducing data movement and making it especially effective for accelerating AI workloads.

- **LLMs** have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving advancements in applications ranging from natural language understanding to content generation. Minimizing their size and computational requirements without compromising performance democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities and broadens their range of applications.
